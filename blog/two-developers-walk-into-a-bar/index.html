  <h1>A Modern App Developer and An Old-Timer System Developer Walk Into a Bar</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 14, 2016</span>
      

<p>Note: Thanks for all the great comments and feedback here and on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11099925">Hacker News</a>. Please keep them coming. I learned a ton and I am sure others will also.</p>

<p>A modern app developer and an old-timer system developer walk into a bar. They had a couple drinks and started talking about the current state of security on the Internet. In a flash of genius, they both decided it would be useful to map the Internet and see what IPs have vulnerable ports open. After some discussion, they decided on the following</p>

<ul>
<li>They will port scan all of the IPv4 address (2^32=4,294,967,296) on a monthly basis</li>
<li>They will focus on a total of 20 ports including some well-known ports such as FTP (20, 21), telnet (23), ssh (22), SMTP (25), etc</li>
<li>They will use nmap to scan the IPs and ports</li>
<li>They need to store the port states as <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html">open, closed, filtered, unfiltered, openfiltered and closedfiltered</a></li>
<li>They also need to store whether the host is up or down. One of the following two conditions must be met for a host to be &ldquo;up&rdquo;:

<ul>
<li>If the host has any of the ports open, it would be considered up</li>
<li>If the host responds to ping, it would be considered up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They will store the results so they can post process to generate reports, e.g.,

<ul>
<li>Count the Number of &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Hosts</li>
<li>Determine the Up/Down State of a Specific Host</li>
<li>Determine Which Hosts are &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in a Particular /24 Subnet</li>
<li>Count the Number of Hosts That Have Each of the Ports Open</li>
<li>How Many Total Hosts Were Seen as &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in the Past 3 Months?</li>
<li>How Many Hosts Changed State This Month (was &ldquo;up&rdquo; but now &ldquo;down&rdquo;, or was &ldquo;down&rdquo; but now &ldquo;up&rdquo;)</li>
<li>How Many Hosts Were &ldquo;Down&rdquo; Last Month But Now It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Up&rdquo;</li>
<li>How Many Hosts Were &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Last Month But Now It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Down&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modern-app-developer-vs-old-timer-developer:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Modern App Developer vs Old-Timer Developer</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume 300 million IPs are up, and has an average of 3 ports open.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>How would you architect this?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Which approach is faster for each of these tasks?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Which approach is easier to extend, e.g., add more ports?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Which approach is more resource (cpu, memory, disk) intensive?</strong></em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t know ElasticSearch all that well, so feel free to correct me on any of the following.</em></p>

<h3 id="choose-a-language:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Choose a Language</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use Python. It&rsquo;s quick to get started and easy to understaind/maintain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use Go. It&rsquo;s fast, performant, and easy to understand/maintain!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="store-the-host-and-port-states:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Store the Host and Port States</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use JSON! It&rsquo;s human-readable, easy to parse (i.e., built in libraries), and everyone knows it!</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>{
	&quot;ip&quot;: &quot;10.1.1.1&quot;,
	&quot;state&quot;: &quot;up&quot;,
	&quot;ports&quot;: {
		&quot;20&quot;: &quot;closed&quot;,
		&quot;21&quot;: &quot;closed&quot;,
		&quot;22&quot;: &quot;open&quot;,
		&quot;23&quot;: &quot;closed&quot;,
		.
		.
		.
	}
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>For each host, I will need approximately 400 bytes to represent the host, the up/down state and the 20 port states.</p>

<p>For 300 million IPs, it will take me about 112GB of space to store all host and port states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use one bit array (memory mapped file) to store the host state, with 1 bit per host. If the bit is 1, then the host up; if it&rsquo;s 0, then the host is down.</p>

<p>Given there are 2^32 IPv4 addresses, the bit array will be 2^32 / 8=536,870,912 or 512MBs</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to store the IP address separately since the IPv4 address will convert into a number, which can then be used to index into the bit array.</p>

<hr />

<p>I will then use a second bit array (memory mapped file) to store the port states. Given there are 6 port states, I will use 3 bits to represent each port state, and 60 bits to represent the 20 port states. I will basically use one uint64 to represent the port states for each host.</p>

<p>For all 4B IPs, I will need approximately 32GB of space to store the port states. Together, it will take me about 33GB of space to store all host and port states.</p>

<p>I can probably use <a href="/blog/bitmap-compression-using-ewah-in-go/">EWAH bitmap compression</a>
 to gain some space efficiency, but let&rsquo;s assume we are not compressing for now. Also if I do EWAH bitmap compression, I may lose out on the ability to do population counting (see below).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="count-the-number-of-up-hosts:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Count the Number of &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Hosts</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a big data problem. Let&rsquo;s use Hadoop!</p>

<p>I will write a map/reduce hadoop job to process all 300 million host JSON results (documents), and count all the IPs that are &ldquo;up&rdquo;.</p>

<hr />

<p>Maybe this is a search problem. Let&rsquo;s use ElasticSearch!</p>

<p>I will index all 300M JSON documents with ElasticSearch (ES) on the &ldquo;state&rdquo; field. Then I can just run a query that counts the results of the search where &ldquo;state&rdquo; is &ldquo;up&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I do realize there&rsquo;s additional storage required for the ES index. Let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of the original document sizes. This means there&rsquo;s possibly another 14GB of index data, bringing the total to 126GB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/zhenjl/bitmap/blob/master/ewah/bitcounter.go#L69">bit counting</a>, or <em>popcount()</em>, problem. It&rsquo;s just simple math. I can iterate through the array of uint64&rsquo;s (~8.4M uint64&rsquo;s), count the bits for each, and add them up!</p>

<p>I can also split the work by creating multiple goroutines (assuming Go), similar to map/reduce, to gain faster calculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="determine-the-up-down-state-of-a-specific-host:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Determine the Up/Down State of a Specific Host</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know, this is a search problem. Let&rsquo;s use ElasticSearch!</p>

<p>I will have ElasticSearch index the &ldquo;ip&rdquo; field, in addition to the &ldquo;state&rdquo; field from earlier. Then for any IP, I can search for the document where &ldquo;ip&rdquo; equals the requested IP. From that document, I can then find the value of the &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This should be easy. I just need to index into the bit array using the integer value of the IPv4, and find out if the bit value is 1 or 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="determine-which-hosts-are-up-in-a-particular-24-subnet:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Determine Which Hosts are &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in a Particular /24 Subnet</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is similar to searching for a single IP. I will search for documents where IP is in the subnet (using CIDR notation search in ES) AND the &ldquo;state&rdquo; is &ldquo;up&rdquo;. This will return a list of search results which I can then iterate and retrieve the host IP.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>This is a map reduce job that I can write to process the 300 million JSON documents and return all the host IPs that are &ldquo;up&rdquo; in that /24 subnet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just another bit iteration problem. I will use the first IP address of the subnet to determine where in the bit array I should start. Then I calculate the number of IPs in that subnet. From there, I just iterate through the bit array and for every bit that&rsquo;s 1, I convert the index of that bit into an IPv4 address and add to the list of &ldquo;Up&rdquo; hosts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="count-the-number-of-hosts-that-have-each-of-the-ports-open:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Count the Number of Hosts That Have Each of the Ports Open</h3>

<p>For example, the report could simply be:</p>

<pre><code>20: 3,023
21: 3,023
22: 1,203,840
.
.
.
</code></pre>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a big data problem. I will use Hadoop and write a map/reduce job. The job will return the host count for each of the port.</p>

<p>This can probably also be done with ElasticSearch. It would require the port state to be index, which will increase the index size. I can then count the results for the search for ports 22 = &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and repeat for each port.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a simple counting problem. I will walk through the host state bit array, and for every host that&rsquo;s up, I will use the bit index to index into the port state uint64 array and get the uint64 that represents all the port states for that host. I will then walk through each of the 3-bit bundles for the ports, and add up the counts if the port is &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Again, this can easily be paralleized by creating multiple goroutines (assuming Go).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-many-total-hosts-were-seen-as-up-in-the-past-3-months:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">How Many Total Hosts Were Seen as &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in the Past 3 Months</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can retrieve the &ldquo;Up&rdquo; host list for each month, and then go through all 3 lists and dedup into a single list. This would require quite a bit of processing and iteration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can perform a simple OR operation on the 3 monthly bit arrays, and then count the number of &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>_Note: I fixed the original AND to OR based on a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11100213">comment from HN</a>. Not sure what I was thinking when I typed AND&hellip;duh!</p>

<h3 id="how-many-hosts-changed-state-this-month-was-up-but-now-down-or-was-down-but-now-up:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">How Many Hosts Changed State This Month (was &ldquo;up&rdquo; but now &ldquo;down&rdquo;, or was &ldquo;down&rdquo; but now &ldquo;up&rdquo;)</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hm&hellip;I am not sure how to do that easily. I guess I can just iterate through last month&rsquo;s hosts, and for each host check to see if it changed state this month. Then for each host that I haven&rsquo;t checked this month, iterate and check that list against last month&rsquo;s result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can perform a simple XOR operation on the bit arrays from this and last month. Then count the number of &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits of the resulting bit array.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-many-hosts-were-up-last-month-but-now-it-s-down:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">How Many Hosts Were &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Last Month But Now It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Down&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can retrieve the &ldquo;Up&rdquo; hosts from last month from ES, then for each &ldquo;Up&rdquo; host, search for it with the state equals to &ldquo;Down&rdquo; this month, and accumulate the results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can perform this opeartion: <code>(this_month XOR last_month) AND last_month</code>. This will return a bit array that has the bit set if the host was &ldquo;up&rdquo; last month but now it&rsquo;s &ldquo;down&rdquo;. Then count the number of &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits of the resulting bit array.</p>
</blockquote>
