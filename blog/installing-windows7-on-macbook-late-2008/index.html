            </header>
            <p><p>Over the weekend I wanted to install Windows in a bootcamp partition so the kids can use it to do their Chinese homework. The Chinese homework CD unfortunately only works in Windows so I had no choice!! I guess I could have taken other routes, like installing Windows in a VM or something, but I figure that Mac has this awesome tool called bootcamp, why not use that?</p>

<p>Well, how wrong I was! I went through a whole day of head-scratching, temper-inducing, word-cussing, USB-swapping and machine-rebooting exercise of getting Windows installed in the bootcamp partition. I almost went as far as buying a replacement superdrive for the macbook, but at the end I finally was able to get Windows 7 onto the Macbook.</p>

<p>To start, my laptop is a Macbook, Aluminum, Late 2008 (MB467LL/A) with a busted optical drive (superdrive). I originally had Mavericks running on it but before this exercise I wiped it clean and installed Yosemite on it. Because the optical drive is busted, I cannot use the Windows 7 DVD, so I had to do this using a USB flash drive.</p>

<p>Below are the steps I took to make this work. I can&rsquo;t guarantee that these steps will work for you, but it&rsquo;s probably good as a reference. Having seen a ton of articles on the problems people had with bootcamp, I hope no one has to go through the troubles I went through.</p>

<ol>
<li>It took me a while to figure this out (after reading numerous online posts), if your Mac has an optical drive, Boot Camp Assistant will NOT create a USB flash drive-based install disk. The only way to trick the system to do that is to do the following: (Though it turns out at the end that this step is quite useless, since the USB install disk created by Boot Camp Assistant couldn&rsquo;t boot! So you could really skip this step.)

<ol>
<li>Modify Boot Camp Assistant&rsquo;s Info.plist as described <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1488322">here</a>.</li>
<li>After the modification, you need to resign Boot Camp Assistant, or else it will keep crashing. To do that, following the instructions <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5479879?start=30">here</a>. For the impatient, run the command <code>sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Start &ldquo;Boot Camp Assistant&rdquo;, and select the options &ldquo;Download the latest Windows Support&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Install Windows 7 or later versions&rdquo;.

<ul>
<li>Note I am not selecting the option to create a Windows install disk. It turned out the USB install disk didn&rsquo;t boot. I keep getting the &ldquo;non-system disk, press any key to continue&rdquo; error, and basically that&rsquo;s the end.</li>
<li>In any case, these two tasks should download the bootcamp drivers onto a USB drive, and also partition the Mac&rsquo;s HD into two partitions. One of the parititions is the BOOTCAMP partition, which will be used to install Windows 7.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, I needed to create a bootable Windows 7 USB Flash drive.

<ul>
<li>If you search the web, you will find that most people run into two problems. The first is the bootcamp-created flash drive giving the &ldquo;non-system disk&rdquo; error, and the second is the boot up hangs with a blank screen and a flash underscore cursor at the top left corner. I&rsquo;ve ran into both. You will also find some articles that explain how to make the flash drives bootable using fdisk, but that didn&rsquo;t work for me either.</li>
<li>Finally I found <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/windows/97075-windows-7-usb-install-stuck-black-screen.html">a post online</a> that pointed to the <a href="http://wudt.codeplex.com/">Windows USB/DVD Download Tool</a>. It&rsquo;s a Windows program that can create a bootable USB flash drive from a Windows 7 or 8 ISO file.</li>
<li>Note though, not all the USB flash drives are created equal. The PNY 16GB drive I used didn&rsquo;t work. WUDT ended with an error that says it couldn&rsquo;t run bootsect to create the boot sectors on the flash drive. The one that worked for me was Kingston Data Traveler 4GB.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now that I have the bootable USB flash drive, I plugged that into the Mac and started it up. This time the installation process got started.</li>
<li>When Boot Camp Assistant created the BOOTCAMP partition, it did not format it to NTFS. So the first thing I noticed was that when I select the BOOTCAMP partition, the installer said it cannot be used because it&rsquo;s not NTFS.

<ul>
<li>The option to format the partition is not immediately obvious, but I had to click on &ldquo;Drive options (advanced)&rdquo; and select the option to format the partition.</li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, I encountered another error that says the drive may not be bootable and I need to change the BIOS setting. Yeah at this point I was pretty ticked and the computer heard a few choice words from me. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do it doesn&rsquo;t seem to let me pass this point.</li>
<li>I did a bunch more readings and research, but nothing seem to have worked. I finally decided to turn the computer off and come back to it. Magically it worked the second time I tried to install it. I was no longer getting the non-bootable disk error. My guess is that after the NTFS formatting, the installer needs to be completely restarted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In any case, at this point, it was fairly smooth sailing. The installation process took a bit of time but overall everything seemed to have worked.</li>
<li>After the installation, I plugged int the bootcamp flash drive with the WindowsSupport files, and installed them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am still not a 100% yet. The trackpad still doesn&rsquo;t behave like when it&rsquo;s on the Mac. For example, I can&rsquo;t use the two finger drag to scroll the windows, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to easily (and correctly) set the brightness of display. But at least now I have a working Windows 7 laptop!</p>
