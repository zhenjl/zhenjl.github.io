        A Modern App Developer and An Old-Timer System Developer Walk Into a Bar

<p>A modern app developer and an old-timer system developer walk into a bar. They had a couple drinks and started talking about the current state of security on the Internet. In a flash of genius, they both decided it would be useful to map the Internet and see what IPs have vulnerable ports open. After some discussion, they decided on the following</p>

<ul>
<li>They will port scan all of the IPv4 address (2^32=4,294,967,296) on a monthly basis</li>
<li>They will focus on a total of 20 ports including some well-known ports such as FTP (20, 21), telnet (23), ssh (22), SMTP (25), etc</li>
<li>They will use nmap to scan the IPs and ports</li>
<li>They need to store the port states as <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html">open, closed, filtered, unfiltered, openfiltered and closedfiltered</a></li>
<li>They also need to store whether the host is up or down. One of the following two conditions must be met for a host to be &ldquo;up&rdquo;:

<ul>
<li>If the host has any of the ports open, it would be considered up</li>
<li>If the host responds to ping, it would be considered up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They will store the results so they can post process to generate reports, e.g.,

<ul>
<li>Count the Number of &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Hosts</li>
<li>Determine the Up/Down State of a Specific Host</li>
<li>Determine Which Hosts are &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in a Particular /24 Subnet</li>
<li>Count the Number of Hosts That Have Each of the Ports Open</li>
<li>How Many Total Hosts Were Seen as &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in the Past 3 Months?</li>
<li>How Many Hosts Changed State This Month (was &ldquo;up&rdquo; but now &ldquo;down&rdquo;, or was &ldquo;down&rdquo; but now &ldquo;up&rdquo;)</li>
<li>How Many Hosts Were &ldquo;Down&rdquo; Last Month But Now It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Up&rdquo;</li>
<li>How Many Hosts Were &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Last Month But Now It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Down&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modern-app-developer-vs-old-timer-developer:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Modern App Developer vs Old-Timer Developer</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume 300 million IPs are up, and has an average of 3 ports open.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>How would you architect this?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Which approach is faster for each of these tasks?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Which approach is easier to extend, e.g., add more ports?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Which approach is more resource (cpu, memory, disk) intensive?</strong></em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t know ElasticSearch all that well, so feel free to correct me on any of the following.</em></p>

<h3 id="choose-a-language:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Choose a Language</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use Python. It&rsquo;s quick to get started and easy to understaind/maintain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use Go. It&rsquo;s fast, performant, and easy to understand/maintain!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="store-the-host-and-port-states:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Store the Host and Port States</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use JSON! It&rsquo;s human-readable, easy to parse (i.e., built in libraries), and everyone knows it!</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>{
	&quot;ip&quot;: &quot;10.1.1.1&quot;,
	&quot;state&quot;: &quot;up&quot;,
	&quot;ports&quot;: {
		&quot;20&quot;: &quot;closed&quot;,
		&quot;21&quot;: &quot;closed&quot;,
		&quot;22&quot;: &quot;open&quot;,
		&quot;23&quot;: &quot;closed&quot;,
		.
		.
		.
	}
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>For each host, I will need approximately 400 bytes to represent the host, the up/down state and the 20 port states.</p>

<p>For 300 million IPs, it will take me about 112GB of space to store all host and port states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will use one bit array (memory mapped file) to store the host state, with 1 bit per host. If the bit is 1, then the host up; if it&rsquo;s 0, then the host is down.</p>

<p>Given there are 2^32 IPv4 addresses, the bit array will be 2^32 / 8=536,870,912 or 512MBs</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to store the IP address separately since the IPv4 address will convert into a number, which can then be used to index into the bit array.</p>

<hr />

<p>I will then use a second bit array (memory mapped file) to store the port states. Given there are 6 port states, I will use 3 bits to represent each port state, and 60 bits to represent the 20 port states. I will basically use one uint64 to represent the port states for each host.</p>

<p>For all 4B IPs, I will need approximately 32GB of space to store the port states. Together, it will take me about 33GB of space to store all host and port states.</p>

<p>I can probably use <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/bitmap-compression-using-ewah-in-go/">EWAH bitmap compression</a>
 to gain some space efficiency, but let&rsquo;s assume we are not compressing for now. Also if I do EWAH bitmap compression, I may lose out on the ability to do population counting (see below).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="count-the-number-of-up-hosts:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Count the Number of &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Hosts</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a big data problem. Let&rsquo;s use Hadoop!</p>

<p>I will write a map/reduce hadoop job to process all 300 million host JSON results (documents), and count all the IPs that are &ldquo;up&rdquo;.</p>

<hr />

<p>Maybe this is a search problem. Let&rsquo;s use ElasticSearch!</p>

<p>I will index all 300M JSON documents with ElasticSearch (ES) on the &ldquo;state&rdquo; field. Then I can just run a query that counts the results of the search where &ldquo;state&rdquo; is &ldquo;up&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I do realize there&rsquo;s additional storage required for the ES index. Let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of the original document sizes. This means there&rsquo;s possibly another 14GB of index data, bringing the total to 126GB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/zhenjl/bitmap/blob/master/ewah/bitcounter.go#L69">bit counting</a>, or <em>popcount()</em>, problem. It&rsquo;s just simple math. I can iterate through the array of uint64&rsquo;s (~8.4M uint64&rsquo;s), count the bits for each, and add them up!</p>

<p>I can also split the work by creating multiple goroutines (assuming Go), similar to map/reduce, to gain faster calculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="determine-the-up-down-state-of-a-specific-host:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Determine the Up/Down State of a Specific Host</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know, this is a search problem. Let&rsquo;s use ElasticSearch!</p>

<p>I will have ElasticSearch index the &ldquo;ip&rdquo; field, in addition to the &ldquo;state&rdquo; field from earlier. Then for any IP, I can search for the document where &ldquo;ip&rdquo; equals the requested IP. From that document, I can then find the value of the &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This should be easy. I just need to index into the bit array using the integer value of the IPv4, and find out if the bit value is 1 or 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="determine-which-hosts-are-up-in-a-particular-24-subnet:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Determine Which Hosts are &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in a Particular /24 Subnet</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is similar to searching for a single IP. I will search for documents where IP is in the subnet (using CIDR notation search in ES) AND the &ldquo;state&rdquo; is &ldquo;up&rdquo;. This will return a list of search results which I can then iterate and retrieve the host IP.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>This is a map reduce job that I can write to process the 300 million JSON documents and return all the host IPs that are &ldquo;up&rdquo; in that /24 subnet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just another bit iteration problem. I will use the first IP address of the subnet to determine where in the bit array I should start. Then I calculate the number of IPs in that subnet. From there, I just iterate through the bit array and for every bit that&rsquo;s 1, I convert the index of that bit into an IPv4 address and add to the list of &ldquo;Up&rdquo; hosts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="count-the-number-of-hosts-that-have-each-of-the-ports-open:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">Count the Number of Hosts That Have Each of the Ports Open</h3>

<p>For example, the report could simply be:</p>

<pre><code>20: 3,023
21: 3,023
22: 1,203,840
.
.
.
</code></pre>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a big data problem. I will use Hadoop and write a map/reduce job. The job will return the host count for each of the port.</p>

<p>This can probably also be done with ElasticSearch. It would require the port state to be index, which will increase the index size. I can then count the results for the search for ports 22 = &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and repeat for each port.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a simple counting problem. I will walk through the host state bit array, and for every host that&rsquo;s up, I will use the bit index to index into the port state uint64 array and get the uint64 that represents all the port states for that host. I will then walk through each of the 3-bit bundles for the ports, and add up the counts if the port is &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Again, this can easily be paralleized by creating multiple goroutines (assuming Go).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-many-total-hosts-were-seen-as-up-in-the-past-3-months:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">How Many Total Hosts Were Seen as &ldquo;Up&rdquo; in the Past 3 Months</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can retrieve the &ldquo;Up&rdquo; host list for each month, and then go through all 3 lists and dedup into a single list. This would require quite a bit of processing and iteration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can perform a simple AND operation on the 3 monthly bit arrays, and then count the number of &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-many-hosts-changed-state-this-month-was-up-but-now-down-or-was-down-but-now-up:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">How Many Hosts Changed State This Month (was &ldquo;up&rdquo; but now &ldquo;down&rdquo;, or was &ldquo;down&rdquo; but now &ldquo;up&rdquo;)</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hm&hellip;I am not sure how to do that easily. I guess I can just iterate through last month&rsquo;s hosts, and for each host check to see if it changed state this month. Then for each host that I haven&rsquo;t checked this month, iterate and check that list against last month&rsquo;s result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can perform a simple XOR operation on the bit arrays from this and last month. Then count the number of &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits of the resulting bit array.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-many-hosts-were-up-last-month-but-now-it-s-down:81495eb0cd198863461f6e4666c91616">How Many Hosts Were &ldquo;Up&rdquo; Last Month But Now It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Down&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Modern App Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can retrieve the &ldquo;Up&rdquo; hosts from last month from ES, then for each &ldquo;Up&rdquo; host, search for it with the state equals to &ldquo;Down&rdquo; this month, and accumulate the results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old-Timer System Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can perform this opeartion: <code>(this_month XOR last_month) XOR last_month</code>. This will return a bit array that has the bit set if the host was &ldquo;up&rdquo; last month but now it&rsquo;s &ldquo;down&rdquo;. Then count the number of &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits of the resulting bit array.</p>

        2016: Analyzing Security Trends Using RSA Exhibitor Descriptions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Feb 5, 2016</span>

    

<p><strong>The data used for this post is available <a href="https://github.com/zhenjl/rsaconf">here</a>. A word of warning, I only have complete data set for 2014-2016. For 2008-2013, I have what I consider to be representative samples. So please take the result set with a big bucket of salt.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Continuing my <a href="http://zhen.org/blog/analyzing-security-trends-using-rsa-exhibitor-descriptions/">analysis from last year</a>, this post analyzes the exhibitors&rsquo; descriptions from the annual security conference, <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us16">RSA 2016</a>. Intuitively, the vendor marketing messages should have a high degree of correlation to what customers care about, even if the messages trail the actual pain points slightly.</p>

<p>Some interesting findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The word <em>hunt</em> has appeared for the first time since 2008. It only appeared 6 times and ranked pretty low, but that&rsquo;s a first nonetheless.</li>
<li>The word <em>iot</em> jumped 881 spots to 192 in 2016, after showing up for the first time in 2015. This may indicate the strong interest in IoT security.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no mention of <em>docker</em> in any of the years, and only 5 mentions of container in 2016. This is a bit of a surprise given the noise docker/container is making. This is likely due to most customers care more about management for new technologies than security.</li>
<li>The word <em>firewall</em> dropped 151 spots in 2016. I want to speculate that it is due to the dissolving of perimeters, but I can&rsquo;t be sure of that.</li>
<li>As much as noise as <em>blockchain</em> is making, there&rsquo;s no mention of the word.</li>
<li>The word <em>behavior</em> (as in behavioral analysis) has also gained drastically over the past few years, going from #370 in 2012 to #78 in 2016.</li>
<li>See other findings below.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="top-words:bb7656c12180a6a78a8c54c60f6a51ce">Top Words</h3>

<p>The top words that vendors use to describe themselves haven&rsquo;t changed much. The following table shows the top 10 words used in RSA conference exhibitor descriptions since 2008. You can find the complete word list <a href="https://github.com/zhenjl/rsaconf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="endpoint-vs-network:bb7656c12180a6a78a8c54c60f6a51ce">Endpoint vs. Network</h3>

<p>While the word <em>network</em> has mostly maintained its top 10 position (except 2013 when it fell to #11), the big gainer is the word <em>endpoint</em>, which improved drastically from #266 in 2012 to 2016&rsquo;s #50. This may indicate that enterprises are much more accepting of endpoint technologies.</p>

<p>I also speculate that there might be a correlation between the increase in <em>cloud</em> and the increase in <em>endpoint</em>. As the perimeters get dissolved due to the move to cloud, it&rsquo;s much more difficult to use network security technologies. So enterprises are looking at <em>endpoint</em> technologies to secure their critical assets.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rsaconf/2016/endpoint-network.png"></p>

<h3 id="compliance-vs-threat:bb7656c12180a6a78a8c54c60f6a51ce">Compliance vs. Threat</h3>

<p>Not surprisingly, the use of the word <em>compliance</em> continues to go down, and the word <em>threat</em> continues to go up.</p>

<p>The number of mentions for <em>threat intelligence</em> remained at 22 for both 2015 and 2016, after jumping from 12 in 2014.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rsaconf/2016/compliance-threat.png"></p>

<h3 id="mobile-cloud-virtual-and-iot:bb7656c12180a6a78a8c54c60f6a51ce">Mobile, Cloud, Virtual and IoT</h3>

<p>While the words <em>mobile</em> and <em>cloud</em> maintained their relative positioning in 2016, we can also see <em>virtual</em> continues its slight downward trend.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the word <em>iot</em> made a big jump, going from position #1073 in 2015 to #193 in 2016. This potentially indicates a strong interest in security for internet of things. In general, the IoT space has seen some major activities, including <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/cisco-buys-jasper-technologies-for-1-4-billion/">Cisco&rsquo;s recent acquisition of Jasper</a>.</p>

<p>The word <em>cyber</em> continues to gain popularity in the past 4 years; however, the word <em>malware</em> has fell below the top 100, a position it maintained since 2010.</p>

<p>The word <em>phishing</em> made drastic gains since 2014, jumping from #807 to #193 in 2016. This may indicate that enterprises are seeing more attacks from phishing, and vendors are targeting that specific attack vector.</p>

        Installing Windows 7 on Macbook Late 2008
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 20, 2015</span>

    <p>Over the weekend I wanted to install Windows in a bootcamp partition so the kids can use it to do their Chinese homework. The Chinese homework CD unfortunately only works in Windows so I had no choice!! I guess I could have taken other routes, like installing Windows in a VM or something, but I figure that Mac has this awesome tool called bootcamp, why not use that?</p>

<p>Well, how wrong I was! I went through a whole day of head-scratching, temper-inducing, word-cussing, USB-swapping and machine-rebooting exercise of getting Windows installed in the bootcamp partition. I almost went as far as buying a replacement superdrive for the macbook, but at the end I finally was able to get Windows 7 onto the Macbook.</p>

<p>To start, my laptop is a Macbook, Aluminum, Late 2008 (MB467LL/A) with a busted optical drive (superdrive). I originally had Mavericks running on it but before this exercise I wiped it clean and installed Yosemite on it. Because the optical drive is busted, I cannot use the Windows 7 DVD, so I had to do this using a USB flash drive.</p>

<p>Below are the steps I took to make this work. I can&rsquo;t guarantee that these steps will work for you, but it&rsquo;s probably good as a reference. Having seen a ton of articles on the problems people had with bootcamp, I hope no one has to go through the troubles I went through.</p>

<ol>
<li>It took me a while to figure this out (after reading numerous online posts), if your Mac has an optical drive, Boot Camp Assistant will NOT create a USB flash drive-based install disk. The only way to trick the system to do that is to do the following: (Though it turns out at the end that this step is quite useless, since the USB install disk created by Boot Camp Assistant couldn&rsquo;t boot! So you could really skip this step.)

<ol>
<li>Modify Boot Camp Assistant&rsquo;s Info.plist as described <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1488322">here</a>.</li>
<li>After the modification, you need to resign Boot Camp Assistant, or else it will keep crashing. To do that, following the instructions <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5479879?start=30">here</a>. For the impatient, run the command <code>sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Start &ldquo;Boot Camp Assistant&rdquo;, and select the options &ldquo;Download the latest Windows Support&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Install Windows 7 or later versions&rdquo;.

<ul>
<li>Note I am not selecting the option to create a Windows install disk. It turned out the USB install disk didn&rsquo;t boot. I keep getting the &ldquo;non-system disk, press any key to continue&rdquo; error, and basically that&rsquo;s the end.</li>
<li>In any case, these two tasks should download the bootcamp drivers onto a USB drive, and also partition the Mac&rsquo;s HD into two partitions. One of the parititions is the BOOTCAMP partition, which will be used to install Windows 7.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, I needed to create a bootable Windows 7 USB Flash drive.

<ul>
<li>If you search the web, you will find that most people run into two problems. The first is the bootcamp-created flash drive giving the &ldquo;non-system disk&rdquo; error, and the second is the boot up hangs with a blank screen and a flash underscore cursor at the top left corner. I&rsquo;ve ran into both. You will also find some articles that explain how to make the flash drives bootable using fdisk, but that didn&rsquo;t work for me either.</li>
<li>Finally I found <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/windows/97075-windows-7-usb-install-stuck-black-screen.html">a post online</a> that pointed to the <a href="http://wudt.codeplex.com/">Windows USB/DVD Download Tool</a>. It&rsquo;s a Windows program that can create a bootable USB flash drive from a Windows 7 or 8 ISO file.</li>
<li>Note though, not all the USB flash drives are created equal. The PNY 16GB drive I used didn&rsquo;t work. WUDT ended with an error that says it couldn&rsquo;t run bootsect to create the boot sectors on the flash drive. The one that worked for me was Kingston Data Traveler 4GB.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now that I have the bootable USB flash drive, I plugged that into the Mac and started it up. This time the installation process got started.</li>
<li>When Boot Camp Assistant created the BOOTCAMP partition, it did not format it to NTFS. So the first thing I noticed was that when I select the BOOTCAMP partition, the installer said it cannot be used because it&rsquo;s not NTFS.

<ul>
<li>The option to format the partition is not immediately obvious, but I had to click on &ldquo;Drive options (advanced)&rdquo; and select the option to format the partition.</li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, I encountered another error that says the drive may not be bootable and I need to change the BIOS setting. Yeah at this point I was pretty ticked and the computer heard a few choice words from me. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do it doesn&rsquo;t seem to let me pass this point.</li>
<li>I did a bunch more readings and research, but nothing seem to have worked. I finally decided to turn the computer off and come back to it. Magically it worked the second time I tried to install it. I was no longer getting the non-bootable disk error. My guess is that after the NTFS formatting, the installer needs to be completely restarted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In any case, at this point, it was fairly smooth sailing. The installation process took a bit of time but overall everything seemed to have worked.</li>
<li>After the installation, I plugged int the bootcamp flash drive with the WindowsSupport files, and installed them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am still not a 100% yet. The trackpad still doesn&rsquo;t behave like when it&rsquo;s on the Mac. For example, I can&rsquo;t use the two finger drag to scroll the windows, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to easily (and correctly) set the brightness of display. But at least now I have a working Windows 7 laptop!</p>
