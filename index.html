        Installing Windows 7 on Macbook Late 2008
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 20, 2015</span>

    <p>Over the weekend I wanted to install Windows in a bootcamp partition so the kids can use it to do their Chinese homework. The Chinese homework CD unfortunately only works in Windows so I had no choice!! I guess I could have taken other routes, like installing Windows in a VM or something, but I figure that Mac has this awesome tool called bootcamp, why not use that?</p>

<p>Well, how wrong I was! I went through a whole day of head-scratching, temper-inducing, word-cussing, USB-swapping and machine-rebooting exercise of getting Windows installed in the bootcamp partition. I almost went as far as buying a replacement superdrive for the macbook, but at the end I finally was able to get Windows 7 onto the Macbook.</p>

<p>To start, my laptop is a Macbook, Aluminum, Late 2008 (MB467LL/A) with a busted optical drive (superdrive). I originally had Mavericks running on it but before this exercise I wiped it clean and installed Yosemite on it. Because the optical drive is busted, I cannot use the Windows 7 DVD, so I had to do this using a USB flash drive.</p>

<p>Below are the steps I took to make this work. I can&rsquo;t guarantee that these steps will work for you, but it&rsquo;s probably good as a reference. Having seen a ton of articles on the problems people had with bootcamp, I hope no one has to go through the troubles I went through.</p>

<ol>
<li>It took me a while to figure this out (after reading numerous online posts), if your Mac has an optical drive, Boot Camp Assistant will NOT create a USB flash drive-based install disk. The only way to trick the system to do that is to do the following: (Though it turns out at the end that this step is quite useless, since the USB install disk created by Boot Camp Assistant couldn&rsquo;t boot! So you could really skip this step.)

<ol>
<li>Modify Boot Camp Assistant&rsquo;s Info.plist as described <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1488322">here</a>.</li>
<li>After the modification, you need to resign Boot Camp Assistant, or else it will keep crashing. To do that, following the instructions <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5479879?start=30">here</a>. For the impatient, run the command <code>sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Start &ldquo;Boot Camp Assistant&rdquo;, and select the options &ldquo;Download the latest Windows Support&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Install Windows 7 or later versions&rdquo;.

<ul>
<li>Note I am not selecting the option to create a Windows install disk. It turned out the USB install disk didn&rsquo;t boot. I keep getting the &ldquo;non-system disk, press any key to continue&rdquo; error, and basically that&rsquo;s the end.</li>
<li>In any case, these two tasks should download the bootcamp drivers onto a USB drive, and also partition the Mac&rsquo;s HD into two partitions. One of the parititions is the BOOTCAMP partition, which will be used to install Windows 7.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, I needed to create a bootable Windows 7 USB Flash drive.

<ul>
<li>If you search the web, you will find that most people run into two problems. The first is the bootcamp-created flash drive giving the &ldquo;non-system disk&rdquo; error, and the second is the boot up hangs with a blank screen and a flash underscore cursor at the top left corner. I&rsquo;ve ran into both. You will also find some articles that explain how to make the flash drives bootable using fdisk, but that didn&rsquo;t work for me either.</li>
<li>Finally I found <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/windows/97075-windows-7-usb-install-stuck-black-screen.html">a post online</a> that pointed to the <a href="http://wudt.codeplex.com/">Windows USB/DVD Download Tool</a>. It&rsquo;s a Windows program that can create a bootable USB flash drive from a Windows 7 or 8 ISO file.</li>
<li>Note though, not all the USB flash drives are created equal. The PNY 16GB drive I used didn&rsquo;t work. WUDT ended with an error that says it couldn&rsquo;t run bootsect to create the boot sectors on the flash drive. The one that worked for me was Kingston Data Traveler 4GB.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now that I have the bootable USB flash drive, I plugged that into the Mac and started it up. This time the installation process got started.</li>
<li>When Boot Camp Assistant created the BOOTCAMP partition, it did not format it to NTFS. So the first thing I noticed was that when I select the BOOTCAMP partition, the installer said it cannot be used because it&rsquo;s not NTFS.

<ul>
<li>The option to format the partition is not immediately obvious, but I had to click on &ldquo;Drive options (advanced)&rdquo; and select the option to format the partition.</li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, I encountered another error that says the drive may not be bootable and I need to change the BIOS setting. Yeah at this point I was pretty ticked and the computer heard a few choice words from me. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do it doesn&rsquo;t seem to let me pass this point.</li>
<li>I did a bunch more readings and research, but nothing seem to have worked. I finally decided to turn the computer off and come back to it. Magically it worked the second time I tried to install it. I was no longer getting the non-bootable disk error. My guess is that after the NTFS formatting, the installer needs to be completely restarted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In any case, at this point, it was fairly smooth sailing. The installation process took a bit of time but overall everything seemed to have worked.</li>
<li>After the installation, I plugged int the bootcamp flash drive with the WindowsSupport files, and installed them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am still not a 100% yet. The trackpad still doesn&rsquo;t behave like when it&rsquo;s on the Mac. For example, I can&rsquo;t use the two finger drag to scroll the windows, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to easily (and correctly) set the brightness of display. But at least now I have a working Windows 7 laptop!</p>

        Analyzing Security Trends Using RSA Exhibitor Descriptions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 22, 2015</span>

    

<p><strong>The data used for this post is available <a href="https://github.com/topclouds/rsaconf">here</a>. A word of warning, I only have complete data set for 2014 and 2015. For 2008-2013, I have what I consider to be representative samples. So please take the result set with a big bucket of salt.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>After going through this analysis, the big question I wonder out loud is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>How can vendors differentiate from each other and stand above the crowd when everyone is using the same words to describe themselves?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The annual security conference, <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15">RSA 2015</a>, is right around the corner. Close to 30,000 attendees will descend into <a href="http://moscone.com">San Francisco Moscone Center</a> to attend 400+ sessions, listen to 600+ speakers and talk to close to 600 vendors and exhibitors.</p>

<p>For me, the most interesting aspect of RSA is walking the expo floor, and listening to how vendors describe their products. Intuitively, the vendor marketing messages should have a high degree of correlation to what customers care about, even if the messages trail the actual pain points slightly.</p>

<p>This post highlights some of the unsurprising findings from analyzing 8 years worth of RSA Conference exihibitor descriptions.</p>

<p>It is interesting how almost all vendor descriptions use the same set of words to describe themselves, and these words mostly haven&rsquo;t changed over the past 8 years. For example, the following table shows the top 10 words used in RSA conference exhibitor descriptions for the past 8 years. You can find the complete word list at &hellip;</p>

<h3 id="compliance-down-threats-up:b082a5c20b5449f4372a8955a4b5d0dd">Compliance Down, Threats Up</h3>

<p>While the macro trend has not changed dramatically for the exhibitor descriptions, there have been some micro trends. Here are a couple of examples.</p>

<p>First, the use of the word <em>compliance</em> has gone down over the years, while the word <em>threat</em> has gone up. After 2013, they changed places with each other.</p>

<p>This finding is probably not surprising. At the end of 2013, one of the biggest breaches, Target, happened. And over the next two years we&rsquo;ve seen major breaches of Sony, Anthem, Home Depot, Premera and many others. Threats to both the corporate infrastructure as well as top executive jobs (just ask <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericbasu/2014/06/15/target-ceo-fired-can-you-be-fired-if-your-company-is-hacked/">Target’s CEO Gregg Steinhafel</a>, or <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/sony-chief-amy-pascal-acknowledges-fired-28918607">Sony&rsquo;s Co-Chairwoman Amy Pascal</a>) are becoming real. So it seems natural for the marketers to start using the word <em>threat</em> to highlight their solutions.</p>

<p><em>Compliance</em> was a big use case in security for many years, and many vendors have leveraged the need for compliance to build their company and revenue pipeline since the mid-2000s. However, use cases can only remain in fashion for so long before customers get sick of hearing about them, and vendors need new ways of selling their wares to customers. So it looks like <em>compliance</em> is finally out of fashion around 2011 and started declining in exhibitor descriptions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rsaconf/compliance-threat.png"></p>

<h3 id="mobile-and-cloud-up:b082a5c20b5449f4372a8955a4b5d0dd">Mobile and Cloud Up</h3>

<p>The words <em>mobile</em> and <em>cloud</em> has gained dramatically in rankings over past 8 years. In fact, it&rsquo;s been consistently one of the top words used in the last 4. For anyone who hasn&rsquo;t been hiding under a rock in the past few years, this is completely unsurprising.</p>

<p>The <em>cloud</em> war started to heat up back in 2009 when most major service providers have felt the Amazon Web Services threat and all wanted to build their own clouds. In fact, I joined VMware in 2009 to build out their emerging cloud infrastructure group to specifically help service providers build their cloud infrastructures. Eventually, in 2011, VMware decided to get into the game and I built the initial product and engineering team that developed what it&rsquo;s now known as vCloud Air (still have no idea why this name is chosen).</p>

<p>As more and more workloads move to the cloud, requirements for protecting cloud workloads quickly appeared, and vendors natually started to position their products for the cloud. So the rise in <em>cloud</em> rankings matches what I&rsquo;ve experiened.</p>

<p>About the same time (2010, 2011 or so), more and more corporations are providing their employees smartphones, and workers are becoming more and more mobile. The need for mobile security became a major requirement, and a whole slueth of mobile security startup came into the scene. So natually the <em>mobile</em> word rose in rankings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rsaconf/mobile-cloud.png"></p>

<h3 id="virtual-and-real-time-regaining-ground:b082a5c20b5449f4372a8955a4b5d0dd">Virtual and Real-Time Regaining Ground</h3>

<p>The words <em>virtual</em> and <em>real-time</em> dropped dramatically in rankings for a couple of years (2010, 2011) but have since regained all the lost ground and more. I have no precise reasons on why that&rsquo;s the case but I have some theories. These theories are probably completely wrong, and if you have better explanations I would love to hear from you.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Virtual</em> lost to <em>cloud</em> during that timeframe as every vendor is trying to position their products for the cloud era. However, <em>virtual</em> infrastructures haven&rsquo;t gone away and in fact continue to experience strong growth. So in the past couple of years, marketers are covering their basis and starting to message both <em>virtual</em> and <em>cloud</em>.</li>
<li>The drop in rankings for <em>real-time</em> is potentially due to the peak of <em>compliance</em> use case, which is usually report-based and does not have <em>real-time</em> requirements. Also, I suspect another reason is that SIEM, which <em>real-time</em> is critical, is going out of fashion somewhat due to the high cost of ownership and lack of trust in the tools. However, given the recent rise of <em>threats</em>, natually <em>real-time</em> becomes critical again.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/rsaconf/virtual-real-time.png"></p>

<h3 id="other-findings:b082a5c20b5449f4372a8955a4b5d0dd">Other Findings</h3>

<p>The word <em>cyber</em> gained huge popularity in the past 3 years, likely due to the U.S. government&rsquo;s focus on <em>cyber</em> security. The word <em>malware</em> has been fairly consistently at the top 100 words since 2010.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rsaconf/cyber-malware.png"></p>

<p>The words <em>product</em> and <em>service</em> switched places in 2013, likely due to the increase in number of security software-as-a-service plays.</p>

<li>The word clouds and word rankings are generated using <a href="http://timdream.org/wordcloud">Word Cloud</a>.</li>
<li>The actual vendor descriptions are gathered from the RSA web site as well as press releases from Business Wire and others.</li>

<h3 id="random-ramblings:29724b4ec2d333ad12e89fd98257dccd">Random Ramblings</h3>

<p>Another week, another report of hacks. This time, <a href="http://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/">The Great Bank Robbery</a>, where up to 100 financial institutions have been hit.Total financial losses could be as a high as $1bn. You can download the <a href="http://25zbkz3k00wn2tp5092n6di7b5k.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/02/Carbanak_APT_eng.pdf">full report</a> and learn all about it.</p>

<p>Sony spent $15M to clean up and remediate their hack. I wonder how much these banks are going to spend on tracing the footsteps of their intruders and trying to figure out exactly where they have gone, what they have done and what they have taken.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t make much progress this week on either <a href="https://github.com/strace/sequence">sequence</a> or <a href="https://github.com/surgemq/surgemq">surgemq</a> because of busy work schedule and my son getting sick AGAIN!! But I did merge the few surgemq <a href="https://github.com/surgemq/surgemq/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">pull requests</a> that the community has graciously contributed. One of them actually got it tested on Raspberry! That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>I also did manage to finish up the <a href="https://github.com/strace/sequence/commit/713979f70d6025308e434205973249aa3138e58e">experimental json scanner</a> that I&rsquo;ve been working on for the past couple of weeks. I will write more about it in the next <a href="http://strace.io/sequence">sequence</a> article.</p>

<p>Actually I am starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by having both projects. Both of them are very interesting and I can see both move forward in very positive ways. Lots of ideas in my head but not enough time to do them. Now that I am getting feature requests, issues and pull requests, I feel even worse because I haven&rsquo;t spent enough time on them. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>

<h3 id="papers-i-read:29724b4ec2d333ad12e89fd98257dccd">Papers I Read</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/HECStorage/git-cercs-12-08.pdf">Memory-Efficient GroupBy-Aggregate using Compressed Buffer Trees</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Memory is rapidly becoming a precious resource in many data processing environments. This paper introduces
a new data structure called a Compressed Buffer Tree (CBT). Using a combination of buffering, compression,
and lazy aggregation, CBTs can improve the memoryefficiency of the GroupBy-Aggregate abstraction which
forms the basis of many data processing models like MapReduce and databases. We evaluate CBTs in the
context of MapReduce aggregation, and show that CBTs can provide significant advantages over existing hashbased
aggregation techniques: up to 2× less memory and 1.5× the throughput, at the cost of 2.5× CPU.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-hu.pdf">ELF: Efficient Lightweight Fast Stream Processing at Scale</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Stream processing has become a key means for gaining rapid insights from webserver-captured data. Challenges
include how to scale to numerous, concurrently running streaming jobs, to coordinate across those jobs to share
insights, to make online changes to job functions to adapt to new requirements or data characteristics, and for each job, to efficiently operate over different time windows. The ELF stream processing system addresses these new challenges. Implemented over a set of agents enriching the web tier of datacenter systems, ELF obtains scalability by using a decentralized “many masters” architecture where for each job, live data is extracted directly from webservers, and placed into memory-efficient compressed buffer trees (CBTs) for local parsing and temporary storage, followed by subsequent aggregation using shared reducer trees (SRTs) mapped to sets of worker processes. Job masters at the roots of SRTs can dynamically customize worker actions, obtain aggregated results for end user delivery and/or coordinate with other jobs.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html">Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Not just a paper, it&rsquo;s a whole book w/ 800+ pages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this book is to help you program shared-memory parallel machines without risking your sanity.1 We hope that this book’s design principles will help you avoid at least some parallel-programming pitfalls. That said, you should think of this book as a foundation on which to build, rather than as a completed cathedral. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to help make further progress in the exciting field of parallel programming—progress that will in time render this book obsolete. Parallel programming is not as hard as some say, and we hope that this book makes your parallel-programming projects easier and more fun.</p>
